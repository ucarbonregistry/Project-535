M/s Trimula Industries Ltd. (TIL) is a leading manufacturer of structural steel in India, equipped with fully
integrated facilities including a power plant, steel melting shop, sponge iron unit, rolling mills, and coal washery.
To meet the growing energy requirements of its operations, TIL has installed a 38.5 MW Waste Heat Recovery
Boiler (WHRB)-based Captive Power Plant (CPP) at its manufacturing site located in Village: Gondwali, Tehsil:
Deosar, District: Singrauli, Madhya Pradesh, India.
The project was commissioned in two phases:
• The first phase became operational on 1st January 2014, with the installation of a 12 MW turbine.
• The second phase commenced on 14th May 2015, with the addition of a 26.5 MW turbine, increasing
the total installed capacity to 38.5 MW.
This WHRB-based CPP utilizes waste heat from industrial processes, enhancing overall energy efficiency and
reducing environmental impact.

Purpose of the project activity:
The purpose of this activity is to enhance energy efficiency, ensure operational continuity, and promote
environmental responsibility by utilizing Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) systems. As industries face increasing
power demands and grid supply constraints, self-sufficiency in energy generation has become a necessity.
This project focuses on recovering the sensible heat content from waste gases emitted by Direct Reduced Iron
(DRI) kilns through Waste Heat Recovery Boilers (WHRB) to generate cleaner electricity. By capturing and
repurposing this otherwise lost energy, the facility reduces its dependency on grid power, lowers operational
costs, and minimizes its carbon footprint. This initiative reflects a strong commitment to sustainability, aligning
industrial growth with environmental stewardship while ensuring energy security and long-term economic
stability.

By recycling waste heat through the WHRB system, the operational load on primary equipment is significantly
reduced. This not only enhances overall energy efficiency but also extends the lifespan of the machinery and
lowers maintenance costs, as components are exposed to reduced thermal stress and mechanical wear.
The project activity results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions by displacing electricity that would
otherwise be generated using conventional fossil fuel-based sources.
_____________
As per the approved UNFCCC CDM methodology, the useful energy generated from the utilization of waste
energy carried in the project activity is for:
(a) Generation of electricity
The project activity is an approved positive activity as per the revised guidelines and updates of UCR, (source of
update). Regulations do not require the PP to recover and/or utilize the waste energy prior to the
implementation of the project activity.

Figure: Captive Power Plant
The project activity is displacing an estimated annual net electricity generation i.e., 517694 MWh from the
Indian grid system, which otherwise would have been generated by the operation of fossil fuel-based gridconnected power plant. The estimated annual average CO2e emission reductions by the project activity is
expected to be 458272 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period shall be
submitted as a part of the initial UCR monitoring and verification activity
